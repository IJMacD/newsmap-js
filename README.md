NewsMap.JS
=========

A pure javascript replacement for the now defunct http://newsmap.jp.

Shows a visual representation of headlines from Google News. Select one or more editions and enable/disable categories to suit yourself.

Implemented in pure Javascript using react. Open source - read source, ask questions, send pull requests. Don't worry I know it's far from perfect!

Donation
--------
Some people have asked for a donation link. While I feel that it's mostly uneccessary since I feel this work is conceptually derivative if not actually technically dervied from any pre-existing code. It also comes pretty close to selling Google News - itself just a content aggregator.

That being said, you can do whatever you like with the following links:
